# Image Processing and Analytics

This repository offers a collection of resources for image processing.

## Books
1. Programming Computer Vision with Python by Jan Erik Solem [(PDF)](http://programmingcomputervision.com/downloads/ProgrammingComputerVision_CCdraft.pdf)
    - This is a good place to start working with images. The book and its examples mainly use
        - Python Imaging Library (PIL) www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ [Handbook](http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm)
        - Numpy http://www.numpy.org/
        - scikit-image http://scikit-image.org/
    - Web site http://programmingcomputervision.com/
    - Code repository: https://github.com/jesolem/PCV
1. Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications by Richard Szeliski [(PDF)](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf)
     - Comprehensive textbook on computer vision.
     - Web site http://szeliski.org/Book/
     
## Applications
- ImageMagic https://www.imagemagick.org/ is a popular selection of image processing tools for the command line. This utility is useful to scale and crop batches of images. (The tools are already installed on arc.insight.gsu.edu)
- GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) https://www.gimp.org is a powerful software, available for all major operating systems.

## Image Processing with OpenCV
